Write a program to initialize a, b and c of values 5, 5 and 10 respectively. Check if following conditions are true or false: Both 'a' and 'b' are greater than'c'. Both
'a' and 'b' are smaller than 'c'
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 5 ,b = 5,c = 10;

    int condition1 = (a > c) && (b > c);
    int condition2 = (a < c) && (b < c);

    printf("Condition 1 (Both 'a' and 'b' are greater than 'c'): %s\n", condition1 ? "True" : "False");
    printf("Condition 2 (Both 'a' and 'b' are smaller than 'c'): %s\n", condition2 ? "True" : "False");

    return 0;
}
