Write  program to insert a node at the a) beginning of a singly linked list. b) end of a singly linked list.

Program(a):

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
struct employee
{
    int serial_number;
    char name[20];
    struct employee *next;
};
int main()
{
    struct employee *head;
    head=malloc(sizeof(struct employee));
    struct employee *current=head;
    current->serial_number=10;
    strcpy(current->name,"manasa");
    current->next=malloc(sizeof(struct employee));

    current=current->next;
    current->serial_number=12;
    strcpy(current->name,"lakshmi");
    current->next=NULL;

    struct employee *add=head;
    head=malloc(sizeof(struct employee));
    current=head;

    current->serial_number=14;
    strcpy(current->name,"royyuru");
    current->next=add;

    current=head;
    while(1)
    {
        if(current)
        {
            printf("%d is %s\n",current->serial_number,current->name);
            current=current->next;
        }
        else
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:
14 is royyuru
10 is manasa
12 is lakshmi

Program(b):

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
struct employee
{
    int serial_number;
    char name[20];
    struct employee *next;
};
int main()
{
    struct employee *head;
    head=malloc(sizeof(struct employee));
    struct employee *current=head;
    current->serial_number=10;
    strcpy(current->name,"manasa");
    current->next=malloc(sizeof(struct employee));

    current=current->next;
    current->serial_number=12;
    strcpy(current->name,"lakshmi");
    current->next=NULL;

    current->next=malloc(sizeof(struct employee));
    current =current->next;
    current->serial_number=16;
    strcpy(current->name,"royyuru");
    current->next=NULL;

    current=head;
    while(1)
    {
        if(current)
        {
            printf("%d is %s\n",current->serial_number,current->name);
            current=current->next;
        }
        else
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:

10 is manasa
12 is lakshmi
16 is royyuru
