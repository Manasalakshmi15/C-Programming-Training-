Initialize variables a, b and c of values 5, 5 and 10 respectively. Check the following relationships between ‘a’ and ‘b’; ‘b’ and ‘c’; ‘a’ and ‘c’ and print the outputs:
==
< 
> 
<=
>=
!=
You can print the results in the format: <a><operator><b> is <bool>

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a=5,b=5,c=10;

    printf("%d == %d is %d\n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d\n", b, c, b < c);
    printf("%d > %d is %d\n", a, c, a > c);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d\n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d\n", b, c, b >= c);
    printf("%d != %d is %d\n", a, c, a != c);

    return 0;
}
