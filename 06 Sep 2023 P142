Write a program to create a structure and display its elements.

Program:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    struct employee
    {
        char name[20];
        int employee_id;
        int age;
        float salary;
    }e1;
    printf("Enter the employee details,Name of the employee,Employee Id,Age of the employee,Salary of the employee:");
    scanf("%s%d%d%f",&e1.name,&e1.employee_id,&e1.age,&e1.salary);
    printf("\nName of the employee:%s \nEmployee Id:%d \nAge of the employee:%d \nSalary of the employee:%f", e1.name,e1.employee_id,e1.age,e1.salary);
    return 0;
}

Output:
Enter the employee details,Name of the employee,Employee Id,Age of the employee,Salary of the employee:ManasaLakshmi 23 20068163 30000

Name of the employee:ManasaLakshmi
Employee Id:23
Age of the employee:20068163
Salary of the employee:30000.000000
