Write a hello world program. Include comments with code explanation.

#include<stdio.h> 
// #include is a preprocesor directive that helps including the header files in the program before the main execution of code.
This enables us to perform the required opertion of header files.
// stdio.h is the header file that include all input/output function details.

int main () 
// This is starting point of main program. It is int type so by the end of main of program it should return some value. 
This is ensure that program has been sucessfully run.The usage of culry braces indicate the begining and ending of the program.

{
 printf("Hello world"); 
 // printf is the output command. Displays the statement inside the quotes on the console screen.
 
 return 0;
 //The main is declared as int type. So returning 0 value to the main function ensures that program is sucessfully run.
}
