Write a program to check if given two strings are same.

Program:
#include <stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int main()
{
    char s1[7]="Manasa";
    char s2[8]="Lakshmi";
    int comp_result= strcmp(s1,s2);
    printf("Result = %d",comp_result);
    return 0;
}
Output:
Result = 1
//bescause the first character of first string has greater value compared to first character of second string.
